# Research Project Laboratory - eBoruta
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Bachelor of Science research project laboratory course (PRL) conducted at Ecole Polytechnique.   
This project focuses on the study and extension of the eBoruta algorithm, along with a comparison of other feature selection algorithms.   

### Repository Contents
- Oil Dataset: A CSV file containing the oil dataset (created by myself) used for the study.  
- Test Data eBoruta: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the application of the eBoruta algorithm on an artificial dataset created for testing purposes.  
- Oil Data eBoruta: A Jupyter notebook presenting the detailed study of the eBoruta algorithm applied to the provided oil dataset.  
- Test Other Algo: A Jupyter notebook that compares the eBoruta algorithm with other feature selection algorithms.  
- Report: A comprehensive report outlining the research methodology, findings, and conclusions.  
- Presentation: The PowerPoint slides used for my project oral presentation.
